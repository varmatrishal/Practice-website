```
mammogram website made in HTML/CSS
```
```
Download all the files in one folder > then open the index to see the website created. 

This was the website created as a example for the Senior Design Project for a Mammogram Solution's project. 
  1. The project allowed compression of DICOM images, which are used for mammogarms, to be compressed, and de-classified and sent 
 to top Oncologists around the world to give expert diagnosis. 
 
  2. Main reason for this project was to help people in poor countries be able to upload images when their internet speed doesn't allow
 large size files to be sent. 
 
  3. The website allows compression - and API is built to also give expert analysis of the tumor based on Machine Learning images.
